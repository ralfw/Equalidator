Project Description
The Equalidator checks for two objects if they are equal - without them implementing any special interface, virtual methods, or attributes.

Equalidator is supposed to help you make your unit tests easier when working with custom data types.
Usage

Use the Equalidator to compare objects and networks of objects of any type for equality. Objects do not need to implement their own class specific Equals() function. ItÂ´s as simple as:

MyObjectNetwork a, b;
...
Equalidator.AreEqual(a, b);

If the object networks are not equal an exception is thrown.

Equality is tested by comparing object field values - even private ones in base classes. The Equalidator uses reflection to crawl the object networks and collect all values.

See the usage demo tests in the source code for more examples.
